I have been leading the development of SaaS applications with Spring Boot backends and Vue.js and Angular frontend for several years. As an architect, I take responsibility for all aspects of the design, development process and operation of the application. I always have an open ear for my colleagues, recognize and resolve conflicts and support everyone individually in their further development. Despite these tasks, I have never lost the fun and passion for writing source code. Before my time as an architect and development manager, I worked for many years as a developer on various projects.

Most recently, I developed a practice system for psychotherapists in the cloud together with my team at [Epikur GmbH](https://www.epikur.de/). Before that, I was head of development of the [open source project verinice](https://github.com/SerNet/verinice) at [SerNet GmbH](https://www.sernet.de/en/) for over 10 years. Verinice is a platform for managing information security and data protection. 

I have been an open source software enthusiast since I started using computers in the 90s. Since then, I have been using free software with open source code professionally as a software developer and development manager, but also privately whenever possible.
